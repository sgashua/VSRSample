# VSRSample
Vertical Slice Architecture + UOW Repository Pattern

I created my small architecture sample for beginners. Mainly for architecture design, not UI.

I prefer less coding and keep everything simple and short.

This sample consists of 3 layers

Presentation (UI)
- WebUI

Core (Business / Service and Entity)
- Application
- Domain

Infrastructure (Data / ORM)
- Persistence

You can run database script (inside sample) to create table that the sample uses. And change your connection string in appsettings.json.

If you like my sample, do buy me coffee to support me!<br>
